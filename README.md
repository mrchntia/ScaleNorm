## Code for my master's thesis "Differentially Private Training of Residual Networks with Scale Normalization"

Exploring the training of residual networks under differential privacy (DP). Development of an architectural adaptation for residual networks that increases the validation accuracy when trained with DP.

[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00324.pdf) is a short version of the thesis.
