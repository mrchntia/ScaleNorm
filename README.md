## Differentially Private Training of Residual Networks with Scale Normalization

Exploring the training of residual networks under differential privacy (DP). Development of an architectural adaptation for residual networks that increases the validation accuracy when trained with DP called ScaleNorm.

This is a selection of skripts written for my master's thesis. I conducted this work at the [Medicine in AI](https://aim-lab.io/) at the Technical University of Munich. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00324.pdf) is a short version of the thesis.
